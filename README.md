# Cyclists_Object_Detection
The Cyclist Object Detection project uses YOLOv5s to develop a real-time detection system for cyclists. Trained on a large dataset of annotated images, the model accurately detects cyclists on roads. The system contributes to improved cyclist safety by providing real-time information about their presence.
